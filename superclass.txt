class Websearch:


What "techniques" do I use to traverse the internet? For accessing gmail, I monotonically click through a list of webpages until arriving at my destination. For stack forums, I usually google a problem and open the most promising tabs. How else to I work the internet? Think about pirate bay, streaming shows, Netflix, etc.
