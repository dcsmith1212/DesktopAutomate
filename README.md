Another object to access pirate bay (TURN ON VPN FIRST)
Object to automate Netflix access (try finding specific aspecets in login screen that indicate the logic isn't complete)

My goal here is to automate as much of my computer use as I can. If I spend substantially less time on my compute performing rote taskes (looking through the first few pages on google search or organizing and backing up files or performing cimilr login or web-acces processes, I can spend more time accomplishing more worthwhile tasks. (Besides that, my eyes and fingers wouldn't mind a little bit less of the screens and keyboard).

What started as a simple automation idea became an idea that would totally expediate the way I use the internet. My first idea is to automate the process of websearching. Often, my use of certain websites can be boiled down to a set list of tasks (thinking of stack exchange and wikipedia), while others are more nuanced, involving many steps that don't occur in every search (netflix or solar movie.


List of sites I visit often:
	- Stack overflow
	- Wikipedia
	- Solar Movie
	- Google
	- Ubuntu forums
	- Sheet music sites?
	- Cooking sites?
	- Pet sites?
	- There are certainly more
	- TRY USING THE SAME PROCESS TO FIND SPOTIFY COMMON MATCHES

All of this being said, I need to develop a class of websites, each with attributes common to all sites but also with more specific attributes (solar movie needs a season and episode specification, while netflix might need a username and pas word or to go through the "Who's watching?" page. Ideally the class will be general enough to scale to a number of my most-visted website, while being flexible enough to handle more specific tasks.

List of attributes common to all sites:
	- Base URL
	- Search query
	- Number of results to be returned
	- Ignorance of incorrect links
	- Incorporation of high ratings (for things like amazon or SO)

	- A way to close that website (or specific tabs)

At the very least, I'll have a system which opens tabs for (or downloads) the thing I was looking for in the first place -- assuming I make the program accurate enough -- or I just have to look it up myself. Either way, the process would be autmoated substantially.
